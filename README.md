## 2. Database Design and Creation
### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) serves as a graphical representation of the Examination System's database structure. It illustrates the entities, attributes, and relationships between them. The ERD is instrumental in conceptualizing and designing the database schema, providing a visual roadmap for database developers and stakeholders.

#### Components of the ERD:
- **Entities**: These represent real-world objects or concepts within the Examination System, such as students, courses, exams, and instructors. Each entity is depicted as a rectangle in the ERD.
- **Attributes**: Attributes describe the properties or characteristics of entities. They are represented as ovals connected to their respective entities in the ERD. Examples of attributes include student ID, course name, exam date, and instructor name.
- **Relationships**: Relationships define how entities are connected within the database. They depict associations between entities and can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships. Relationship lines connecting entities in the ERD indicate these associations.
- **Cardinalities**: Cardinalities specify the number of instances of one entity that are related to another entity in a given relationship. They are indicated using symbols such as "1" for one-to-one relationships, "1-M" for one-to-many relationships, and "M-N" for many-to-many relationships.

### Mapping
The mapping process involves translating the conceptual model represented by the ERD into a physical database schema. This entails defining tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints based on the entities and relationships identified in the ERD.

#### Steps in Entity-Relationship Mapping:
1. **Identifying Entities and Attributes**: Entities and their attributes are identified from the ERD, with each entity corresponding to a database table and each attribute mapping to a table column.
2. **Defining Relationships**: Relationships between entities are translated into foreign key constraints in the database schema, establishing connections between related tables.
3. **Establishing Primary Keys**: Primary keys are defined for each table to uniquely identify records. Typically, primary keys correspond to attributes designated as unique identifiers in the ERD.
4. **Enforcing Referential Integrity**: Referential integrity constraints are implemented to maintain data consistency and enforce relationships between related tables. These constraints ensure that foreign key values in child tables reference valid primary key values in parent tables.
5. **Indexing**: Indexes are created on columns frequently used in queries to improve data retrieval performance. Indexes enhance database efficiency by facilitating rapid access to specific data subsets.

### Advantages of Entity-Relationship Mapping:
- **Clarity and Consistency**: Mapping ensures that the database schema accurately reflects the conceptual model depicted in the ERD, promoting clarity and consistency in database design.
- **Data Integrity**: By enforcing referential integrity constraints, mapping helps maintain data integrity and prevents inconsistencies in the database.
- **Optimized Performance**: Well-designed mappings, including appropriate indexing strategies, contribute to optimized database performance and efficient query processing.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: A carefully mapped database schema provides a scalable and flexible foundation for accommodating future changes and enhancements to the Examination System.

The entity-relationship mapping process lays the groundwork for the development of a robust and efficient database that meets the data storage and retrieval needs of the Examination System.
