- **ETL Implementation (CSV to Database)**: ETL processes were implemented to efficiently transfer data from CSV files into the MS SQL Server database.
- **Stored Procedures Implementation**: Stored procedures for database operations were designed and implemented.
- **Data Warehouse (DWH) Design and Creation**: The schema and architecture for the Data Warehouse were designed.
- **ETL Implementation (Database to Data Warehouse)**: Additional ETL processes were implemented to transfer data from the MS SQL Server database to a Data Warehouse (DWH).
- **Desktop Application Development**: The desktop application for administering exams and managing data was created.
- **Reporting Functionality**: Reporting tools were integrated, and various reports were implemented as per requirements.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Thorough testing was conducted to ensure system functionality and reliability.
- **Documentation**: The system architecture, functionalities, and usage guidelines were documented.


## 2. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The ERD illustrates the relationships between entities in the database schema. It provides a visual representation of how data is organized and connected within the system.
